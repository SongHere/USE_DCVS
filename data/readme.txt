Y-channel of nine videos with the QCIF(176*144), CIF(352*288), NTSC(720*480), and 720P(1280*720) resolutions are used here.

Hall (330 frames) and Crosswalk (CW, 270 frames) are two surveillance videos disturbed by heavy noise and with sparse and dense foreground objects, respectively.

Container, Foreman, Coastguard, and Soccer (300 frames) are general videos with moving senses, and their motion speed ranges from gentle to intense.

News, Football, and FourPeople are common videos with large resolutions.
