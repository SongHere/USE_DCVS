USE_DCVS: Unified Sparsity Estimation-based Distributed Compressive Video Sensing

The source codes and data of the work "Adaptive Rate Compression for Distributed Video Sensing in Wireless Visual Sensor Networks"

codes are coming soon


The multi-hypothesis[1] and residual reconstruction[2] techniques are used for reconstruction, in which the SPG-L1[3] algorithm was used to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems.
